# Web Scrapping
This repostiroy contains a file **script.py** used to scrape a list of [courses|https://www.udacity.com/courses/all?price=Free] from Udacity for the Udacity 30 day challenge created by me. A list of all the courses and relavent information is first stored into a python dataframe and then tranfered into a SQLite database to make it easy to query the data.
