# Web Scraping (Udacity 30 Day Challenge)
This repository contains the file **script.py** used to scrape a list of free [courses](https://www.udacity.com/courses/all?price=Free) and their relavent information from Udacity for the Udacity 30 day challenge created by me. The information is first stored in a python dataframe and then transferred into a database to make it easy to query the data locally.

To run the program, clone the repository and run the below command inside a virtual environment. SQLite needs to be installed [separately](https://www.sqlite.org/download.html). 

```pip install -r requirements.txt```

Once all the dependencies are installed  run the python script in the terminal using the command below.

```python script.py```
